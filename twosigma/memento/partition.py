"""
When re-shuffling data it is often useful to be able to
have a function return multiple outputs, each of which
is efficiently independently loadable.

A partition has a string key and arbitrary values.

When written, all the data are provided and
the values are written to different storage blocks for
each key.

When read, a handle to the partition is returned. No
data is transferred until a key is given, at which point
the data for that key is retrieved.

Example
=======

>>> from twosigma.memento import memento_function
>>> from collections import defaultdict
>>>
>>> @memento_function
>>> def words_by_letter():
>>>     result = defaultdict(lambda: [])
>>>     # provided by `apt-get install wamerican`
>>>     with open("/usr/share/dict/words") as f:
>>>         for word in f.readlines():
>>>             first_letter = word[0].upper()
>>>             result[first_letter].append(word.rstrip())
>>>     return InMemoryPartition(result)
>>>
>>> r = words_by_letter()
>>>
>>> # List keys in the result
>>> r.list_keys()
dict_keys(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N',
           'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'Ã…', 'Ã‰'])
>>> # Get only the words that begin with A
>>> r.get("A")
['A', "A's", 'AMD', "AMD's", 'AOL']
